This project is a delivery drone simulation program designed to embody real world drone operations. The simulation takes user input destination location to model realistic flight scenarios. Additionally, the program incorporates a dynamically generated battery level that decreases over time, reflecting the energy consumption of an actual drone. Based on these parameters, the system determines whether the drone can safely proceed with the delivery or must abort the mission. After a short processing gap, the simulation provides an outcome such as "Delivery successful" "Cannot deliver due to low battery" or another appropriate status message effectively demonstrating the decision-making process of an autonomous delivery system
